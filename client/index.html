                <p>
                    <b>Welcome!</b> In this exercise, you will test out an experimental
                    remote viewing technology developed here at Xtech and also
                    gain valuable experience out in the field!
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>The Device:</b>
                    The X Remote Viewer Handheld Device (i.e. the device you are holding)
                    is linked with those of your squadmates. Using this, we are
                    able to predict an aerial view of a small area that around
                    the average position of the devices, even if they are located
                    across the country or around the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>The Interface:</b>
                    When you begin the mission, the top half of your screen will
                    display a blue dot at your location, a red dot at your squad's
                    average position, and initials at each squad member's position.

                    On the bottom of the screen, collected data is displayed: as
                    you move around, more of the aerial view is obtained and more
                    of the image is revealed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>The Mission</b>
                    Find the secret message (underlined green text) in an
                    abandoned building. We believe that the immediate
                    surroundings of this message are somehow linked to Russian
                    art. When you're ready, enter your initials below and begin!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Misc. Advice:
                    Use HTTPS.
                    Turn off WiFi and reload this page on cellular before beginning.
                    Do not refresh your browser; this will return you to the center
                    of the map.
                </p>
